- **TL;DR:** A data viz case study that carefully demonstrates how the question can guide the correct viz for the job.

- Where infrastructure engineering meets experimentation. This post summarizes a recent Netflix paper covering their experimentation platform for infrastructure testing.

> This is a fascinating paper from members of Netflix’s Resilience Engineering team describing their chaos engineering initiatives: automated controlled experiments designed to verify hypotheses about how the system should behave under gray failure conditions, and to probe for and flush out any weaknesses.

# Teams

[**Data as a Product vs. Data as a Service**](https://medium.com/@itunpredictable/data-as-a-product-vs-data-as-a-service-d9f7e622dc55) \| [**@itunpredictable**](https://twitter.com/itunpredictable)

- **TL;DR:** This is a great write-up on the difference between product-oriented and service-oriented data teams. It makes the case that teams 1) must start as product-oriented and deliver before carefully navigating the shift to service-oriented, and 2) the difference between the two styles is critical for hiring decisions. Its got some good quips too.

> What’s the job of a data team? There’s no one or clear answer, which helps explain why the field is such a complete shit show right now.

> If you hire strategic, functional data people to do Data-as-a-Product things like reporting and modeling, they will be unhappy, they will leave, and you will fail.

> Without someone dedicated to finding a solution to all problems, no matter how difficult, eventually a large problem will come along and kill you while you’re still weak.  Founding teams need a Chief Optimist...

# Organizations

- Thiel rarely makes podcast appearances and it's interesting to see where his head is at two years into Trump--- he was a big supporter in 2016 but has been fairly under the radar since.
- Speaking of Thiel, he made some wild claims this past week that Google has been infiltrated by the Chinese government: [Check it out](https://www.axios.com/peter-thiel-says-fbi-cia-should-probe-google-9846a042-e689-49bc-bdc7-595988ce5d8c.html).

> The author believes this is one of the first papers in the sustainability management field to conclude that climate-induced societal collapse is now inevitable in the near term and therefore to invite scholars to explore the implications.

# The Dementors

![Dementors]({{ site.url }}/img/dementors.png)

> "Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life." — Remus Lupin's description of dementors in the Harry Potter series

I've been lucky to have many mentors. Some were awe-inspiring and others not so much, but in hindsight each imparted something that I later became grateful for. One in particular was extraordinarily busy and always overwhelmed. I detested the traits that came with this: high-pressure, anxiety, and burnout. However this person had a sort of superpower.

We would be in the most stressful situation for hours then abruptly halt to attend something like a meeting. As soon as they entered their entire demeanor would shift. They would become centered, patient, and insightful. Further, they were never a bystander. If need be they could swiftly grab the wheel and shift the room's tone and direction to avoid derailment. People left energized and inspired.

This shift blew my mind every time. I couldn't figure out how they did it or reconcile it with their otherwise hurried persona. It's one thing to have grit and stamina, but this was something else. They turned on a dime.

A few months after noticing this we had a particularly grueling day and they repeated the feat. Everyone left and when it was just us I blurted:

"How do you do that?"

"What?"

"That. We had an insane day. It's like midnight on a Tuesday. They were all fried too and they left laughing."

"Oh, whenever I walk into a room, when I come through that door I think 'What do the people in here need from me? What's the ideal outcome? How can I help get us there and make the experience a good one?'"

"*Oh.*"

That was it. I went home and here I am still thinking about it many years later.

Whatever room you enter next the people in that room have no idea what's on your mind. It doesn't matter; don't burden them with it. Your goal is to empathize, make things better if you can, and certainly help avoid things getting any worse. You don't have to dominate or be the boss to do this. You just have to remember the goal, pay attention, and engage.

Once you notice this it becomes clear that most people fall into one of a few camps. Some share this higher goal. Finding and aligning yourself with these people is a good strategy if you actually want to get things done and do so happily. Most are ambivalent or unintentional. They drift in and out aimlessly. If the situation degrades they are quick to reach for their phone or otherwise disengage. They don't actively make things worse but they can't be depended on to make things better.

There's a third type with a different sort of superpower: they drain energy from a room. They're like dementors. Pay close enough attention and when they enter you can feel a cold draft follow. They're engaged but often lose sight of the big picture, love to throw wrenches, avoid nuance, and otherwise create confusion. These behaviors make solutions feel more distant, not less, and leave others feeling overwhelmed. It's not intentional; it's just somehow become their default. If enough people aren't willing to engage and overpower them they can deadlock a whole room, project, or team.

So, engage, seek clarity, help make things better, and find others who do the same. I was burned a bit by the person that taught me this but when I enter a room I often take a deep breath, clear my head, and briefly think about what the best possible outcome could be. For that, I am grateful.
