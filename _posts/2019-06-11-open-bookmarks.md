**I've moved my bookmarks to the web!**

... well, at least the ones worth sharing.

For now they mostly contain resources I've found useful in a day-to-day data job.

Check them out in the nav-bar above, or hop to a category from below:

- [**Tools**](https://pdtenpas.github.io/pages/bookmarks/tools/): Tools of the trade.

- [**Platforms and Products**](https://pdtenpas.github.io/pages/bookmarks/platforms_products/): Data platforms and the products built on them.

- [**Analysis and Experiments**](https://pdtenpas.github.io/pages/bookmarks/analysis_experiments/): Useful framing for escaping the noise.

- [**Roles, Teams, Orgs**](https://pdtenpas.github.io/pages/bookmarks/roles_teams_orgs/): How data roles fit into teams and teams into orgs.

- [**Jobs, Careers, Life**](https://pdtenpas.github.io/pages/bookmarks/jobs_careers_life/): Useful framing for getting a job/career/life.

- [**News Sources**](https://pdtenpas.github.io/pages/bookmarks/sources/): Data and tech newsletters, blogs, and podcasts.

- [**Misc**](https://pdtenpas.github.io/pages/bookmarks/misc/): Abstract concepts and more.

Stay tuned... lots of work in progress but there are some gems in there.
