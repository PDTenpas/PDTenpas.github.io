- Mary Meeker’s annual absolute-monster-of-a-slide-deck Internet Trends Report is out. If you're not familiar, once a year VC's gather to hit the right arrow key over the deck and spin hot takes on Twitter. Here are ten trends ARK Invest picked out:

> 1. After more than a decade during which the share of ad dollars allocated to mobile trailed its usage, the gap has closed. Now that each approximates 33%, mobile ad sales probably will increase concomitantly with usage.
> 2. E-commerce continues to increase in the US, hitting 15% of retail sales in 2018.
> 3. Podcasts are blowing up— in 2018, 70 million Americans listened to podcasts, more than triple from 22 million a decade ago.
> 4. While declining at Facebook and WeChat, usage is increasing at YouTube and Instagram. YouTube probably will eclipse Facebook in daily usage in the not too distant future.
> 5. People care less about privacy today than they did five years ago. The percent of people who say they care about internet privacy dropped from 64% in 2014 to 52% today.
> 6. The percent of encrypted web traffic increased from 53% in 2016 to 87% in 2019.
> 7. The workplace continues to distribute: the percentage of US workers working remotely increased from 3% in 2000 to 5% in 2017.
> 8. Participation in online courses like 2U and Coursera continues to climb. While only 4% of students complete unpaid courses like Cousera, 50% complete paid courses like 2U.
> 9. Last year, China’s mobile data consumption almost tripled, thanks to short video platforms like TikTok and Kuaishou.
> 10. In 2018, roughly 10 million people participated in genomics tests, a phenomenal leap from nearly zero in 2012.

- **TL;DR:** Alex Danco mulls over what could happen if we allow companies to bundle themselves with our broken housing system. This thought experiment reads like a Black Mirror episode (back when they were good at least).

> Why am I bringing this up? Well, I’ve heard the idea thrown around, in serious discussion, that part of the reason housing remains stubbornly expensive is that the free market and the software boys haven’t been able or allowed to use software and the internet to its full potential to creatively bring down costs.


[**Uber's Path of Destruction**](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/) \| [**Exponential View**](https://www.exponentialview.co/)

- The hottest of hot takes on Uber's grow-at-all-cost expansion strategy:

> What Uber has disrupted is the idea that competitive consumer and capital markets will maximize overall economic welfare by rewarding companies with superior efficiency. Its multibillion dollar subsidies completely distorted marketplace price and service signals, leading to a massive misallocation of resources. Uber’s most important innovation has been to produce staggering levels of private wealth without creating any sustainable benefits for consumers, workers, the cities they serve, or anyone else.

# The Honorable Robber

![Chainmail]({{ site.url }}/img/chainmail.png)

Facebook has announced details on [their new currency, Libra](https://libra.org/en-US/), and everyone has a hot take. Two stuck out to me:

[**Facebook Will Make the Money Now**](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-18/facebook-will-make-the-money-now) \| [**Money Stuff**](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine)

- Matt Levine dug into the nitty gritty of Libra's governance and asset structure.

> If you mostly spend dollars, and Libra is always going up and down against the dollar, that will be annoying and you won’t want as many Libras. But if you mostly spend Libras—if Facebook is successful at making this the main currency of the internet—then that dynamic will reverse. If the dollar is always going up and down against the Libra, that will be annoying and you’ll want more Libras. The dollar will start to seem unstable and useless.

> Isn’t it a little bit amazing that the banking system both lets you have access to your money to buy stuff at any time and pays you interest on that money? (I mean, not very much now, but in general.) It is a weird nice fact that that norm evolved, but it’s not clear that it would evolve again independently. The Libra tradeoff is: You can use your money, but we’re keeping the interest on it.

> Libra knows that you don’t necessarily trust Facebook to run the currency. It’s just asking you to trust Facebook to turn the currency over to a truly decentralized system, sometime, somehow, when it figures out what that system might look like.

[**ProfG Coin — Scorpio**](https://www.profgalloway.com/profg-coin) \| [**No Mercy / No Malice**](https://www.profgalloway.com/)

- Scott Galloway had a slightly more optimistic take though he thinks lack of trust will eventually kill the project.

> Within financial services, the remittance industry (wires, sending money home) is a $500 billion industry where the unbanked (the poor) are molested with 7% fees. A stablecoin that facilitates inexpensive transfers of funds across borders could be the largest tax cut for the poor since vaccinations. In addition, hundreds of millions of banked people are vulnerable to poor governance and unstable currencies that result in vaporization of their savings (Argentina) or eating trash to survive (Venezuela).

This framing of the upside certainly sounds great. Just imagine a scenario where the same fees existed domestically:

You grow up in a lower class family in the rust belt. Despite the odds, you take on a boat load of loans, get a good education, escape to a coastal city where earning potential sky rockets and manage to climb a few rungs into the upper-middle class pretty quickly. Someone in your family is hit with a chronic illness and thanks to our healthcare system your family's finances are decimated. You can afford to help and contact a bank to set up a recurring transfer back home. The bank tells you if it's in-state, fine, but if it's across any of these arbitrary lines they're taking a cool 7% off the top.

Well, that feels gross and I struggle to see how it's all that different from the current international system. And if you're totally unbanked you don't really have any options at all. Yeah, If we can just skirt that whole mess with a made-up currency that sounds good to me.

Despite this something still feels off about Libra's approach, particularly the humanitarian angle they've taken ([check out the site](https://libra.org/en-US/) for a taste of the branding). It solves some of the problems of the unbanked but does so by offering a worse version of what we currently have, i.e. you get no interest, are forced to trust a foreign corporation, and the whole thing is aligned with that corporation's interests but look, no fees. The pitch seems to be... *"Hey so we have this really shitty financial services industry in the developed world, but you probably have no financial services, so here's an arguable worse version of our services but it's better than what you have so we are the good guys here."*

The underlying model of Libra feels eerily similar to some of Facebook's past efforts. Remember when [they wanted to fly internet-providing drones over remote parts of the world](https://www.wired.com/story/what-happened-to-facebooks-grand-plan-to-wire-the-world/) but then it was revealed users could only access a Facebook-approved subset of the internet, one that would of course benefit Facebook, and the whole thing was kiboshed? Both projects remind me of this passage from the book *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave*:

> I could see no reason why I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of my toil into the purse of my master... He would, however, when I made him six dollars, sometimes give me six cents, to encourage me. It had the opposite effect. I regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole. The fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof, to my mind, that he believed me entitled to the whole of them. I always felt worse for having received any thing; for I feared that the giving me a few cents would ease his conscience, and make him feel himself to be a pretty honorable sort of robber.

It turns out Facebook actually did carry out [the goals of that internet project](https://medium.com/@anneconnelly/why-facebooks-new-libra-coin-is-good-and-really-bad-for-the-world-4446a816fa23) just more discreetly by partnering with mobile providers. It's been wildly successful. [Users in these countries believe Facebook *is* the internet](https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/)— it's the only window they've had to the web.

From that perspective, Libra's approach sounds awfully familiar: Find those desperately in need of a service, offer to provide it but in an altered structure that heavily benefits the provider, claim the moral high ground as if you're solving Humanity's most important problems. The honorable robber robs on.
