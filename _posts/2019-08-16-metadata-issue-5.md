# Approaches

[**The Little Book of Python Anti-Patterns**](https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/index.html) \| [**PyCoder's Weekly**](https://pycoders.com/)

> This is a small book of Python anti-patterns and worst practices. Learning about these anti-patterns will help you to avoid them in your own code and make you a better programmer (hopefully).

[**A reference guide for fintech & small-data engineering**](https://medium.com/dangerous-engineering/a-reference-guide-for-fintech-small-data-engineering-bd65b9796d90) \| [**Locally Optimistic Slack**](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/community/)

- This is a phenomenal article. A more fitting title may be: *A reference guide to impactful engineering work and the cultures that allow for it.*

- **TL;DR:** It starts by making the case that your problems probably aren't the same as Twitter/Instagram/etc so stop obsessing over what they're doing. Then it lays out what the important problems are at each level of software systems, how to choose what to buy vs build, how teams should be organized, how to prioritize systemic fixes and maintenance work, why you should build platforms, how to become an excellent engineer, and the pitfalls along the way.

- The platform arguments remind me a lot of [**Stevey's Google Platforms Rant**](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611)—if you like this stuff, and you're lucky enough to not have read this yet, I highly recommend it.

> Some companies allow teams to carve out juicy projects for themselves and prevent other folks from working on them. This kind of technical bureaucracy cuts through engineering morale like a hot knife through butter. Teams shouldn’t claim projects, they should claim problems.

> Multiple times in my career I’ve made the decision to adopt a higher bar for my own work. Each time it slowed me for a bit but then I sped right back up. This, as far as I can tell, is how great software engineers get that way. Their brains aren’t different than yours or mine, they just have higher standards for themselves.

> Any place that doesn’t let you fundamentally fix the system that you’re in charge of is a place you don’t want to work.

# Careers

[**Don’t Let Architecture Astronauts Scare You**](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/) \| [**Dangerous Engineering**](https://medium.com/dangerous-engineering)

- **TL;DR:** Don't forget that architecture is simply a means to an end; your job is to provide value.

> When you go too far up, abstraction-wise, you run out of oxygen. Sometimes smart thinkers just don’t know when to stop, and they create these absurd, all-encompassing, high-level pictures of the universe that are all good and fine, but don’t actually mean anything at all.

[**Breakout List: Career Planning Guide for People in the Technology Industry**](https://breakoutlist.com/career-planning/) \| [**Conor Dewey's Newsletter**](https://www.conordewey.com/newsletter)

- A great list of content for thinking about and planning a tech career.

[**Skinner as Self-manager (pdf)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1284070/pdf/jaba003000300545.pdf) \| The source was lost to the void, apologies.

- B. F. Skinner is most well-known for establishing the field of experimental behavior research in psychology. Today, many of his theories on conditioning are [now baked into software](https://www.1843magazine.com/features/the-scientists-who-make-apps-addictive) to make features and products stickier to users.
- **TL;DR:** It turns out Skinner used the same ideas from his research to modify his own behavior. I.e. he may have been one of the first methodical life / productivity hackers—sorry Tim Ferriss.

# Elsewhere in Tech...

[**Animation Is Eating The World: Lessons from the past, present, and future of animation**](http://www.michaeldempsey.me/animation/) \| [**@mhdempsey**](https://twitter.com/mhdempsey)

- A long read covering the incredible progress happening in animation.

# You and Your Research

[![Chalkboard]({{ site.url }}/img/chalkboard_banner.png)]({{ site.url }}/img/chalkboard_banner.png)

> I have to get you to quit your modesty. I have to get you individually, to respond to my challenge that you're going to be great. You have to say to yourself, “Yes, if that guy Hamming can go out and become a great scientist, I can. Or I can become a great person.” I have to get you to say to yourself that you want to. That's it's worth the effort. And you're going to try to be something more than just the average person.

Los Alamos, Bell Labs, ~10 books, a who's who list of collaborators, and [many scientific contributions stamped with his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming)—Richard Hamming had quite the career.

After Bell Labs, he took up teaching positions and ended up teaching a graduate capstone titled "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn," later publishing a book of the same name which, today, can be bought [used on Amazon for ~$1K](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/9056995014/ref=tmm_pap_used_olp_sr?ie=UTF8&condition=used&qid=&sr=).

The course's last lecture, "You and Your Research," had a huge impact on me as an undergraduate. We watched it on Youtube, projected in a mostly empty lecture hall on a day when the professor couldn't make it in. It may as well have been called "You and Your Life" and even Hamming jokes at the start that the title isn't quite right but research is what he knows best.

The premise of the lecture is this: Hamming noticed early in his career that he wasn't on track for doing significant things with his life. He was determined to figure out why and whether it was worth the effort try. The lecture is a report on what he learned in pursuit these questions.

## Below are my notes:

**Why try to do significant work? Is the effort worth it?**
- You have one life to lead, I'd recommend you try to do something significant.
- In old age, which do you want to say: "well, I didn't do any harm, I had an enjoyable life, I had a good time." OR "I did something I thought was important."
- The unexamined life is not worth living.
- All those that accomplish great things say it was the best experience of their life.

**Isn't it just luck?**
- Yes and no. You prepare yourself day by day and when the lightening strikes (luck) you're either ready or you're not.
- The day-to-day is constant hard work. Nothing more, nothing less.

**Great people believe they can do great work.**
- Beware of overconfidence but if you don't believe you can do great work it's not likely you ever will.
- When stuck, charge forward. Attack problems with courage.

**If you don't work on important problems you will not do important things.**
- You have to start small but the things you work on must have the potential to be big.
- If what you're working on is not important, and is not likely to lead to important things, why are you working on it?
- Many abandon a good idea too soon or cling to a bad idea too long.
- If you cling to anything, cling to the desire to do excellent work.
- If you have a vision you will go a long way.

**What is an important problem?**
- Importance is not based on the consequence of solving a problem alone.
- It's also based on whether or not a problem has an attack: a new approach or potential way of solving it.
- EX: Teleportation is not an important problem. It has massive consequences but there is no attack.
- Redefine, invert, and change the nature of the problem; important problems hide.
- Problems become important when there is an attack towards a solution.
- Most great scientists have 10-20 problems in their mind. When they get a clue about how to attack one, they drop everything and rush to that problem to finish it off.
- Spend ~10% of your time thinking about what these important problems may be, what's happening more broadly, and where things are headed.

**Put hooks on ideas.**
- "Often someone would tell me something I knew was true, but I couldn't think of it first. This frustrated me.""
- When you get new piece of information turn it around many ways until it's connected to many other pieces of information.
- I.e. form a mental map. What you're working on has to fit into the bigger picture.

**Those who work with their door shut, don't know what to work on.**
- An open door and an open mind are correlated.
- Many people believe ignoring others is a good method for focusing on important problems.
- Almost always, door-closed people work on *slightly* the wrong problem.
- You have to communicate with others to find important problems.

**You must become good at communicating.**
- You must be good at writing, conference talks, and casual talks.
- You must be really clear and straightforward in communicating problems and solutions.
- The way you communicate a problem is often completely different then the way you found a problem.
- To learn this always listen for two things 1) the content and 2) the style.
- Style is hard to define. It's answers to questions like: what was effective? Why was it effective? What can you adapt?
- When you find someone who is very effective, you have to try and adapt it to you. You must learn your own style, you can't copy one.

**Study Success.**
- Stop studying failure so much. When you see something great, study that.
- Why did this talk succeed? Why did this project succeed? Why did this person succeed? Ask more of these questions.
- It was the right problem, attacked the right way, at the right time. How so for each of those?  

**Tolerate Ambiguity.**
- Both believe and disbelieve: believe enough to keep working, disbelieve enough to question it.
- Stop being so certain everything you hear is correct.
- Hamming admits this trait is difficult to teach / communicate.

**Embrace Change.**
- No change = no progress
- This will not be comfortable for you and many you work with. Learn to welcome it against your intuition.

**The onus is on you to demonstrate greatness**
- Demonstrate you can do it first, then you will get the freedom to pursue it fully.
- "The more we leave him alone, the more he'll think about what should be done, and the more we'll actually get done."
- Remember most people, when given freedom, do nothing.
- Don't blame the system, it won't help you solve important problems, do the best you can given your circumstances.

**Reorganize your life**
- Cut the cruft. Organize your life around doing significant things, whatever that means to you. "Get down and be somebody worth being."
- "I've told you things about how to succeed. No one ever told me these things I've been telling you. Nobody. I had to find them for myself."
- "I have told you how to succeed. You have no excuse for not doing better than I did.""
