# Debt

Not enough nuance is used when discussing technical debt and it only gets murkier in the data world.

[**Towards an understanding of technical debt**](https://kellanem.com/notes/towards-an-understanding-of-technical-debt) \| [**Kellan's Notes on Engineering Leadership**](https://kellanem.com/notes/)

> There are at least 5 distinct things we mean we say “technical debt”.

> The first step to addressing any problem is understanding it. When we conflate these 5 different phenomena we confuse ourselves about possible solutions.

> Quickly we find ourselves in a situation where we’re undertaking major engineering projects without having correctly diagnosed what caused the issues we’re trying to solve.

[**Scientific Debt**](http://varianceexplained.org/r/scientific-debt/) \| [**Variance Explained**](http://varianceexplained.org/posts/)

> Scientific debt is when a team takes shortcuts in data analysis, experimental practices, and monitoring that could have long-term negative consequences.

> What’s important in both technical and scientific debt is to keep the long-term cost in mind.

# Thinking

[**The problem with counterfactuals**](https://lorinhochstein.wordpress.com/2019/08/22/the-problem-with-counterfactuals/) \| [**Software Weekly**](https://us12.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=0e61a764c5cf33d9f3eff0749&id=846fac531b)

> While counterfactual reasoning helps restore our feeling that the world makes sense, the problem with it is that it doesn’t help us get better at avoiding or dealing with future incidents.

[**Don't End The Week With Nothing**](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing) \| [**The Idea Muse**](https://neilkakkar.com/)

> I'll close with my usual advice to peers: reading this email was valuable (knock on wood). Watching Jason's video is valuable. Rolling up your sleeves and actually shipping something is much, much more valuable. If you take no other advice from me ever, ship something. You'll learn more shipping a failure than you'll learn from reading about a thousand successes. And you stand an excellent chance of shipping a success -- people greatly overestimate how difficult this is. Just don't end the week with nothing.

# Show Me What You Got

![What You Got]({{ site.url }}/img/whatyougot_banner.png)

I've been on both sides of the interview table quite a bit the past few years. I'm still learning a lot about hiring processes but one thing I keep coming back to is opinions. As an interviewer, I try to get a strong opinion or hot take out of a candidate. As a candidate, I look for those opportunities or try to steer the conversation towards them. The ability to do the work is table stakes. Having an opinion on _how_ it should be done? That's far more interesting.

Consider what's involved in sharing a strong opinion. For starters, it can take a lot of work just to get to a place where you can form one. Strong opinions are often learned the hard way. And to share one in an interview? That's risky. What if someone disagrees? Do both parties know how to navigate that? To concede misunderstandings? To bring up what they don't know or would need to know to resolve it? It sounds like a path to rejection, but it's actually way more similar to, I don't know, _the actual work you'd be doing on the job_.

Strong opinions aren't just a good test for candidates. If a company doesn't want to hear your opinions, or is turned off by them, is that a place you'd want to work? Opinions can change! That's how teams work. It's the job of the interviewer to assume the candidate has opinions, make sure they are comfortable enough to share them, and provide the opportunity. If they can't do that, it could signal a culture that can't handle disagreement or hasn't put real thought behind hiring.

I love watching people take leaps of faith. Take a risk to say something and trust that I'd help before letting it fall flat. I'd appreciate the same in return. That's a real conversation and a good interview, but I don't know, that's just like, my opinion, man.
