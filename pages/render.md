# Tools

[Open-sourcing Polynote: an IDE-inspired polyglot notebook](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/open-sourcing-polynote-an-ide-inspired-polyglot-notebook-7f929d3f447) \| [**Data Science Roundup**](http://roundup.fishtownanalytics.com/)

- **TL;DR:** Netflix has open-sourced a new notebook interface that addresses a [some of the long-standing criticisms of Jupyter Notebooks](https://twitter.com/joelgrus/status/1033035196428378113?s=20): reproducibility, better editing tools, clearer visibility into the kernel, and dependency management tools.

[**Modin: Scale your pandas workflow**](https://github.com/modin-project/modin) \| [**PyCoder's Weekly**](https://pycoders.com/)

> Modin uses Ray to provide an effortless way to speed up your pandas notebooks, scripts, and libraries. Unlike other distributed DataFrame libraries, Modin provides seamless integration and compatibility with existing pandas code. Even using the DataFrame constructor is identical.

[**Why you should use `python -m pip`**](https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/) \| [**Normcore Tech**](https://vicki.substack.com/)

> I cannot count the number of times I had to help someone who thought pip was installing into one Python interpreter and in fact it was the other. And that immeasurable count also applies to when people have broken their system or wondered why they couldn't install something that conflicted with some other thing they installed previously for some other project, etc. due to not bothering to set up an environment on their local machine.
> So for your sanity and mine, use python -m pip and always try to use an environment.

# A/B Testing Platforms

[**The Engineering Problem of A/B Testing**](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-engineering-problem-of-a-b-testing-ac1adfd492a8) \| [**Conor Dewey's Newsletter**](https://www.conordewey.com/newsletter)

- A high-level overview of the engineering problems behind A/B testing systems, set of approaches towards solving them, and a few tips to avoid common pitfalls.

[**Leaky Abstractions In Online Experimentation Platforms**](https://booking.ai/leaky-abstractions-in-online-experimentation-platforms-ae4cf05013f9) \| [**Conor Dewey's Newsletter**](https://www.conordewey.com/newsletter)

- An introduction to the law of leaky abstractions, the ways they often show up in experimentation platforms, and how to mitigate their risks towards experiment health.

# Hot Takes

[**Making Wrong Code Look Wrong**](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/) \| [**The Idea Muse**](https://neilkakkar.com/)

- A great case study showing that a simple name change can go miles towards making code more readable. Takeaway:

>  The way to write really reliable code is to try to use simple tools that take into account typical human frailty, not complex tools with hidden side effects and leaky abstractions that assume an infallible programmer.

[**You’re all calculating churn rates wrong**](https://medium.com/swlh/youre-all-calculating-churn-rates-wrong-cbab072cd992) \| [**Conor Dewey's Newsletter**](https://www.conordewey.com/newsletter)

> [the standard churn metric] actually tells you nothing useful about churn, but really relates to the age of the subscriptions you have. It will in most cases go down on it’s own, and, absurdly, the only way to keep it from going down is to have very high growth. So the number will literally only look bad if your business is doing extremely well, and optimizing for it will be directly counter-productive. The error here is a simple statistical mistake that is easy to make, and luckily also easy to understand and avoid.

[**Modern Data Practice and the SQL Tradition**](https://tselai.com/modern-data-practice-and-the-sql-tradition.html) \| [**Data Eng Weekly**](https://dataengweekly.com/)

> Especially among the young breeds of data practitioners, there is a growing consensus that SQL is not “cool”, not good enough or even worse “SQL is not professional enough and real data scientists should code”. My own experience, however, has taught me otherwise.
