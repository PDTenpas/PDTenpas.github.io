Hello, I'm Parker.

I'm from Oshkosh, Wisconsin and currently live in Brooklyn, New York. I've had stints in Denver, Colorado and Honolulu, Hawaii as well.

I work in data. Past experiences include biomedical research, political campaigns, mobile apps, and ecommerce. Very different industries but always data.

Outside of the day job I work on side projects from data work to podcasts, newsletters, blogs, and video editing. Most of them end up shelved but I'm usually working on something new and tend to share it here.

Find me elsewhere on the internet by clicking the icons down below.
