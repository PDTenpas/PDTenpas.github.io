I'm from Oshkosh, Wisconsin and live in Brooklyn, New York. I've had stints in Denver, Colorado and Honolulu, Hawaii as well.

I work in data. Past experiences include time at the Harlow Center for Biological Psychology, the 2016 Clinton Presidential Campaign, and ecommerce companies Casper and Primaryâ€”very different industries but always data. I've recently started a new role on the data team at [TrialSpark](https://medium.com/trialspark/mission-and-purpose-at-trialspark-790a63539350).
