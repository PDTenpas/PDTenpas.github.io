I'm originally from Oshkosh, Wisconsin and am currently hiding in the woods around Lake Tahoe. Outside of pandemics, I'm usually in Brooklyn, New York.

I work in data. Past experiences include time at the Harlow Center for Biological Psychology, the 2016 Clinton Presidential Campaign, a few years in ecommerce, and most recently, healthtech. Very different industries but always data.

I've recently started crunching numbers at [Headway](https://headway.co/).
