## Statistical Significance Pitfalls

[The garden of forking paths: Why multiple comparisons can be a problem, even when there is no “fishing expedition” or “p-hacking” and the research hypothesis was posited ahead of time](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)

-> Our key point here is that it is possible to have multiple potential comparisons, in the sense of a data analysis whose details are highly contingent on data, without the researcher performing any conscious procedure of fishing or examining multiple p-values.
