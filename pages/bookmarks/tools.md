There's really too many of these to cover in any sort of useful summary. I'm going to list a few lists of resources I've found useful and pull out some of my favorites below.

## Opinionated python

[**Minimally Sufficient Pandas**](https://medium.com/dunder-data/minimally-sufficient-pandas-a8e67f2a2428)

> In this article, I will offer an opinionated perspective on how to best use the Pandas library for data analysis. My objective is to argue that only a small subset of the library is sufficient to complete nearly all of the data analysis tasks that one will encounter. This minimally sufficient subset of the library will benefit both beginners and professionals using Pandas.

[**What's the future of the pandas library?**](https://www.dataschool.io/future-of-pandas/)

> The pandas core team now encourages the use of "method chaining".
