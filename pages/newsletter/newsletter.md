title: Metadata Newsletter
subtitle: A data & tech newsletter of newsletters.
---

MetaData is a newsletter of newsletters where I share my favorite finds and thoughts from weekly newsletter reading along with their sources.

First there was content, then there were newsletters to curate content. Now there’s a newsletter that curates newsletters that curate content.

The focus here is mostly on what I find interesting/useful as someone working a standard day-to-day data job. The goal is to send you the good stuff and help you find other newsletters, blogs, and podcasts to subscribe to.

Mostly, I'm just obsessed with newsletters and started this as way to justify the habit.

Every new edition goes directly to your inbox every sometimes— I’m not quite sure what the right frequency is yet but we’ll figure it out. It will never be more than weekly.
