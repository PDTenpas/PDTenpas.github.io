[Local Maxima](https://local-maxima.com/) is a casual conversation podcast hosted by me and good friend [Ryan Kladar](https://twitter.com/RKladar) that probably takes itself too seriously but life is effort and we'll stop when we die.

You can find the latest episode on all common podcast apps like Overcast, Spotify, Pocketcasts, iTunes, Google Play, etc or on the [website](https://local-maxima.com/).
